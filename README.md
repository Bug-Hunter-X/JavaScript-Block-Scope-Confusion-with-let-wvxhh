# JavaScript Block Scope Confusion
This example demonstrates a common source of confusion in JavaScript related to block scope when using the `let` keyword.

The code in `bug.js` shows how variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block of code they are defined in (within an if statement in this case). This can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered.

The solution in `bugSolution.js` offers a clearer explanation and highlights best practices to avoid this type of error.  Understanding block scope is crucial for writing clean and bug-free JavaScript code.
